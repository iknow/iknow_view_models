require 'view_model/access_control_error'

## Defines an access control discipline for a given action against a viewmodel.
##
## Access control is based around three edit check hooks: visible, editable and
## valid_edit. The visible determines whether a view can be seen. The editable
## check determines whether a view in its current state is eligible to be
## changed. The valid_edit change determines whether an attempted change is
## permitted. Each edit check returns a pair of boolean success and optional
## exception to raise.
